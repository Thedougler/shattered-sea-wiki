# CR Reference Tables

## Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating

This is the canonical table for balancing monster stat blocks. Use it in conjunction with the CR calculation in SKILL.md.

## HP Calculation Guide

Hit dice by size:

| Size | Hit Die | Average per Die |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Tiny | d4 | 2.5 |
| Small | d6 | 3.5 |
| Medium | d8 | 4.5 |
| Large | d10 | 5.5 |
| Huge | d12 | 6.5 |
| Gargantuan | d20 | 10.5 |

**Formula**: HP = (number of dice × average per die) + (number of dice × CON modifier)

Example: 15d10 + 45 (CON +3) = 15 × 5.5 + 15 × 3 = 82.5 + 45 = **127 HP**

## Effective HP Adjustment for Resistances / Immunities

When calculating defensive CR, adjust HP before looking up in the table:

| Condition | Multiplier | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Resistance to common physical (B/P/S nonmagical) | ×2 | Very common below CR 10 |
| Resistance to one damage type | ×1.25 | Only if commonly used by parties |
| Resistance to two+ damage types | ×1.5 | |
| Immunity to one damage type | ×1.5 | If uncommon type (poison, fire) |
| Immunity to common physical (B/P/S) or multiple types | ×2 | Dramatic defensive uplift |
| Regeneration | +regeneration per round × 4 to effective HP | Only if not suppressed by acid/fire |

| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | −5 | 16–17 | +3 |

| 6–7 | −2 | 22–23 | +6 |
| 8–9 | −1 | 24–25 | +7 |

| 12–13 | +1 | 28–29 | +9 |
| 14–15 | +2 | 30 | +10 |

## Condition Reference (for Ability Design)

| Condition | Key Effect | Best Used For |
|---|---|---|
| Blinded | Can't see; attacks at disadvantage; attacks against at advantage | Lurkers, ambushers |
| Charmed | Can't attack charmer; charmer has social advantage | Fey, enchanters |
| Frightened | Disadvantage on attacks/checks when source visible; can't move toward source | Fear-based monsters |
| Grappled | Speed 0; escape requires action | Grabbers, constrictor types |
| Paralyzed | Incapacitated + auto-crit from adjacent; fails STR/DEX saves | High-CR controllers |
| Petrified | Incapacitated + resistant to damage + immune to poison/disease | Basilisks, medusas |
| Poisoned | Disadvantage on attacks and ability checks | Venomous creatures |
| Prone | Adjacent attacks at advantage; ranged at disadvantage; half move to stand | Trip-focused brawlers |
| Restrained | Speed 0; attacks against at advantage; own attacks at disadvantage; DEX save disadvantage | Web-spinners, grabbers |
| Stunned | Incapacitated + can't move; auto-fail STR/DEX saves; attacks against at advantage | Very powerful — limit per fight |

**Design note:** Paralyzed and Stunned are the two most powerful conditions — use sparingly. Restrained is the safe middle-ground controller condition. Frightened is underrated: it controls space without removing agency.
