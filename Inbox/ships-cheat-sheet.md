# Ships & Bastion — Quick Reference

---

## Ship Tiers

| Tier | Examples | Cargo | Guns | Cost (used) | Min / Full Crew | Upkeep/wk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Sloop, cutter, lugger | 20 tons | 2–6 | 800–2,000 gp | 2–4 / 8–12 | 20–40 gp |
| **2** | Brigantine, schooner | 60 tons | 8–16 | 4,000–10,000 gp | 8–10 / 20–30 | 80–145 gp |
| **3** | Frigate, galleon | 150 tons | 20–40 | 15,000–35,000 gp | 20–25 / 55–80 | 270–430 gp |
| **4** | First-rate ship of the line | 100 tons | 80–112 | Crown property only | 55 / 280 | ~1,400 gp |

**Below minimum crew** — all ship checks at disadvantage; speed –20%.  
**Upkeep** — due weekly whether sailing or docked. Missing it is handled narratively.  
**Tier 4** — exists only as [[HCS-Sovereign|Crown property]]. Not acquirable.

## Ship Stats

**AC, Hull Points, and Combat Speed** — 2024 DMG vehicle stat blocks, mapped to campaign tiers:

| Tier | Closest DMG Type | AC | Hull Points | Combat Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Keelboat | 15 | 100 | 10 ft. |
| **2** | Sailing Ship | 15 | 300 | 20 ft. |
| **3** | Warship / Galley | 15 | 500 | 25–40 ft. |
| **4** | Custom (first-rate) | 15 | 700 | 20 ft. |

All wooden vessels: **Damage Immunities** poison, psychic. **Condition Immunities** blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, stunned, unconscious.

- **Condition** — Pristine / Worn / Damaged / Wrecked. Tracked narratively; mechanical penalties apply when relevant.
- **Repairs at sea** — Carpenter role required. Short rest: DC 15 Dexterity (Carpenter's Tools); success restores 2d8 + proficiency bonus HP. In port: 1 gp per HP, 1 workday per 25 HP.

## Crew Roles

| Role | Required When | Key Ability | Hireling/wk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Captain** | Always | Charisma | — (PC or major NPC) |
| **Navigator** | Open-water voyages | Int (Navigator's Tools) | 10 gp |
| **Bosun** | Always | Str or Dex | 8 gp |
| **Gunner** | Guns in use | Dexterity | 8 gp |
| **Carpenter** | Repairs at sea | Int (Carpenter's Tools) | 6 gp |
| **Cook** | Voyages over 3 days | Wisdom | 4 gp |
| **Surgeon** | Surgeon's Berth facility | Wis (Medicine) | 8 gp |
| **Marine** | Boarding party actions | Str or Dex | 14 gp + wages for any other role filled during non-combat watches |
| **Ordinary Sailor** | Always (see tier minimums) | — | 2 gp |

**PC in role** — adds their modifier to relevant checks.  
**Hireling in role** — baseline competence; uses own stat block if a check is forced.  
**Role unfilled** — that function can't be performed, or rolls at disadvantage.

---

## At Sea

**Navigation checks** — roll when: reef channels, Maw approach, storm, unfamiliar waters. Navigator uses **Intelligence (Navigator's Tools)**.

| DC  | Failure                                                |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 10  | Off course. +1 day.                                    |
| 14  | Significantly off course. +2 days, minor complication. |
| 18  | Lost. +1d4 days, serious complication.                 |

- Tidewardens' charts: **advantage** in charted waters. Midchain charts: contradictory, no advantage.
- **Within 5 miles of the Maw:** compass and magical nav fail. Star navigation still works. Compass Rose solves this.

**Long rests** — standard 2024 rules. Cook role filled: +1d6 HP recovered. Storm during rest: DC 12 Con save or rest grants no benefits.

## Ship Upgrades

| Rarity | Access | Examples |

| Common | Port Tidefall | Weatherglass (200 gp), Signal Lantern pair (300 gp), Compass Rose (400 gp) |
| Uncommon | Faction contacts / specialists | Wind Caller's Boom (1,200 gp), Ghost-Keel Coating (900 gp), Fog Cannon (1,500 gp) |

## Bastion

One shared bastion for the whole party. Slots pool across all PCs. Bastion Turns resolve weekly at sea or in port. Facilities work at sea as long as minimum crew is filled.

### Levels, Slots & Facility Gates

Both character level and ship tier must be met to install a facility.

| Character Level | Slots/PC | Party Pool (5 PCs) | Unlocks | Min Ship Tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Any | — | — | Basic facilities | Any |
| 5 | 2 | 10 | Level 5 facilities | 1 |
| 9 | 3 | 15 | Level 9 facilities | 2 |
| 13 | 4 | 20 | Level 13 facilities | 3 |
| 17 | 5 | 25 | Level 17 facilities | 3 |

Ship size determines which facility tiers are available, not how many fit. Handle physical space narratively.  
**Facility replacement** on level-up: shipyard port + 3 days.

### Bastion Turn Orders

| Order | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Craft** | Produce items allowed by the facility. |
| **Empower** | Trigger the facility's power effect. |
| **Harvest** | Collect facility outputs. |
| **Maintain** | No order — roll a Bastion Event. |
| **Recruit** | Hire hirelings, defenders, or specialists. |
| **Research** | Gather intel or identify items. |
| **Trade** | Generate income via commerce. |

Absent PCs need *Sending* to issue orders. No order = Maintain. Neglect kicks in after consecutive missed turns equal to the PC's level.

## Facilities

### Level 5 — Tier 1+

| Ship Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| Navigator's Chart Room | *Identify* at low levels; Arcana item crafting at L9+. |
| Weapons Locker | Upgrades defender dice d6 → d8. |
| Crew Berths | Recruits and houses up to 12 Defenders. |
| Provisions Store | Produces Basic Poison or Healing Potions each turn. |
| Chart Archive | Research orders for navigation, history, factions. |
| Waveservant Shrine | Standing Umberlee propitiation — counts as having paid the departure offering every voyage. Standard Sanctuary mechanics apply. |
| Carpenter's Shop | Crafts mundane gear; Armaments magic items at L9+. |
| Expanded Cargo Hold | Trade income, scales significantly with level. |
| Rigger's Workshop | Implement magic items; grants Heroic Inspiration via Short Rest. |
| Surgeon's Berth **[HB]** | Once/turn: stabilize all downed crew, or remove disease/poison (8 hrs), or *Lesser Restoration* without a slot. Requires Surgeon role filled. |

### Level 9 — Tier 2+

| Ship Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| Officer's Mess | ~70 gp/week gambling income. |
| Hydroponics Bay | Greater Healing Potions and stronger poisons. |
| Tinker's Workshop | Any-rarity potion/poison crafting with Alchemist's Supplies. |
| Reliquary Shrine | Relic magic items; spell slot refresh for spellcasters. |
| Ship's Logbook Room | **Only facility that crafts spell scrolls.** Also produces false documents. |
| Sparring Deck | One week of training grants combat buffs for one week. |
| Captain's Trophy Cabinet | 50% chance to research a Common magic item. Low priority. |

*Excluded at this tier:* Teleportation Circle, Theater, Stable.

### Level 13 — Tier 3 only

| Ship Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| Captain's Archive | Legend Lore research without a spellcaster. |
| Navigator's Sanctum | **Best defensive facility.** Empower: roll twice on Bastion Events, choose either — reduces Attack chance from 1-in-20 to 1-in-400. |
| Beast Hold | House captured creatures (CR 2 or lower) for one-time poison harvesting. Situational. |
| Crow's Nest Observatory | Free level-5 spell effect (DC 15 Int save). Especially useful for non-spellcasters. |
| Ship's Galley | 24-hour buff drinks. Bigby's Burden and Sterner Stuff are standouts for a sea crew. |
| Sacred Hold | *Greater Restoration* free (no diamond dust). Enables *Revivify*, *Stoneskin*, etc. |

### Level 17 — Tier 3 only

| Ship Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| Merchant Consortium | Six guild variants. Bakers'/Brewers' = 500 gp/week. Masons' = free hull plating. Shipbuilders' = build a vessel in 40 days at cost. |
| Admiral's Sanctum | Free *Heal*, renewable THP, and Sanctum Recall — instant teleport back to the ship for the whole party. |
| Command Deck | Up to 10 Lieutenants, each commanding 100 soldiers. Plot-scale tool — discuss with DM before selecting. |

*Excluded at this tier:* Demiplane.

## Bastion Events at Sea

Triggered when any facility takes the Maintain order while underway.

| Event Type | Shipboard Version |
|---|---|
| Local threat/attack | Hostile vessel tracking or intercepting. |
| Beneficial contact | Passing ship offers trade, intel, or opportunity. |
| Structural damage | Storm/incident damages a facility; repair via vehicle rules. |
| Windfall | Favorable current — voyage shortened 1d4 days. |
| Hireling issue | Hireling problem requiring party response. |

In port, use 2024 bastion event rules as written.

---

## Defense

**Attack event** — roll 6d6. Each 1 kills one Defender. No Defenders left: one Special Facility shuts down for one Bastion Turn.

**Armored Hull** — reinforced hull acts as Defensive Walls; reduces Attack dice from 6d6 to 4d6. Cost: 250 gp per 5-ft exterior section. (Masons' Guild variant provides this for free.)

| Ship State | Defense Modifier |
|---|---|
| Party aboard | Resolve through play |
| In port, party absent | RAW bastion defense |
| Underway, full experienced crew | +3 |
| Underway, skeleton crew | +0 |
| Underway, below minimum crew | –2 |

Crew Berths Recruit order adds up to 12 Defenders at once — do this once and it covers years of Attack events.

## Ship's Guns — Quick Reference
